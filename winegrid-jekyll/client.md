## **Context and problem**
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
      <div class="container">
        <p></p>
        <p>The work at the wine cellar consists in evaluate the vats and control values via a central dashboard. The main problem is when some employer needs to control the values of a specific vat when he is near them and not in the office near the dashboard. This would make the employer go to the office look for that specific vat in the system and see the values and probably go back to the vat. This is the problem that we need to solve thus simplifying and saving time to the employees.

## **Proposed solution**

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
      <div class="container">
        <p></p>
        <p>The proposed project aims at an easy way for wine producers and their employees to control their data via a smartphone application that they can directly connect to each wine barrell with a QR Code that pairs with a smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy. This application can predict the best time to collect samples or predict the ideal time of fermentation process. The employees can  also set an alarm to remind them of tasks they have to do on certain vat and also take notes of what they need to control or to remember later. They can also finish the process in order to terminate the communication with the sensor.
